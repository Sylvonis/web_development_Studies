                Where did you learn what it means to reciprocate?
                And how much can I be expected to tolerate? Uh
                So I started to think 'bout the plans I made
                The debt unpaid
                And you just can't call a spade a spade

                I watch the moon
                Let it run my mood
                Can't stop thinking of you
                I watch you (now I let it go)
                (And I watch as things play out like)
                So long nice to know you I'll be moving on

                We started off in such a nice place
                We were talking the same language
                I open and I'm closing
                You can't stand the thought
                Of a real beating heart
                You'd be holding, having trouble
                Owning and admit that I am hoping

                I watch the moon
                Let it run my mood
                Can't stop thinking of you
                I watch you (now I let it go)
                (And I watch as things play out like)
                So long nice to know you I'll be moving on
                Moving on

                You, yeah I always know the truth
                But I can't just say it to you
                Yeah, I know the truth
                I knew
                Yeah, I always know the truth
                But I can't just say it to you
                Yeah, I know the truth

                I never thought we'd see it through
                I never could rely on you
                And few times your face came into view
                Into view
                I'm not into you
                Into you
