        Where did you learn what it means to reciprocate?
        And how much can I be expected to tolerate? Uh
        So I started to think 'bout the plans I made
        The debt unpaid
        And you just can't call a spade a spade

        I watch the moon
        Let it run my mood
        Can't stop thinking of you
        I watch you (now I let it go)
        (And I watch as things play out like)
        So long nice to know you I'll be moving on

        We started off in such a nice place
        We were talking the same language
        I open and I'm closing
        You can't stand the thought
        Of a real beating heart
        You'd be holding, having trouble
        Owning and admit that I am hoping

        I watch the moon
        Let it run my mood
        Can't stop thinking of you
        I watch you (now I let it go)
        (And I watch as things play out like)
        So long nice to know you I'll be moving on
        Moving on

        You, yeah I always know the truth
        But I can't just say it to you
        Yeah, I know the truth
        I knew
        Yeah, I always know the truth
        But I can't just say it to you
        Yeah, I know the truth

        I never thought we'd see it through
        I never could rely on you
        And few times your face came into view
        Into view
        I'm not into you
        Into you</pre>
